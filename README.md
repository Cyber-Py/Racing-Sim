# Car Racing Simulator!

In this game you will be simulating a car racing game. 

***Disclaimer: This is text-based, not an actual game! As i dont know how to use `pygame`***

This file will walk you throught the game.

### ***The Mainmenu:***
When you start, it will show you this:
```
You are at level 1 with 100XP
You have $100
You have 10 Gems
Your current car is: Holeshot
You have completed 0 races
Would you like to:
[1] Race
[2] Shop
[3] Spin The Wheel Of Chance
```

Its pretty self-explanatory; it tells you your level, your XP, coins, gems, car that is being used, and how many races have been completed

***

### ***Racing:***
Once you press `1`, the program will redirect you to the **racing area**, in which you actually don't have to do anything. The program will start the countdown, 10 seconds go by and one lap is done, another 10 seconds and the second lap is done and it will tell you your results, along with how much XP and Coins you get.

**Countdown:**

Should look something like this:
```
3...

2...

1...

GO
```

**During the Race:**
```
5 minutes into the first lap of the race
```
**After Race:**
